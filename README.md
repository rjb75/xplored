## What is xplored?

The purpose of xplored is to allow users to make and update travel plans for future trips they will be going on. Our application will allow users to search travel websites in order to store and organize the plans they make. By collecting this information for their trips into one easily accessible and simple-to-use place, we will create a more relaxing experience for our users.
